## What programming is not!

When you look at the “programming” bookshelves in a random bookstore, you will see loads of books that promise to turn you into a programmer on the spot.
Now that you have worked your way through some first examples, however, you probably realize that this cannot possibly happen.

Acquiring the mechanical skills of programming—learning to write expressions that the computer understands, getting to know which functions 
and libraries are available, and similar activities—isn’t helping you all that much with real programming. If it were, you could equally well learn a 
foreign language by memorizing a thousand words from the dictionary and a few rules from a grammar book.

Good programming is far more than the mechanics of acquiring a language. Most importantly, it is about keeping in mind that programmers 
create programs for other people to read them in the future. A good program reflects the problem statements and its important concepts. 
It comes with a concise self-description. Examples illustrate this description and relate it back to the problem. 
The examples make sure that the future reader knows why and how your code works. In short, good programming is about solving problems systematically 
and conveying the system within the code.Best of all, this approach to programming actually makes programming accessible to everyone—so it serves two 
masters at once.
